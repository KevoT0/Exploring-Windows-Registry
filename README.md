# Exploring-Windows-Registry

<h2>Description</h2>
This project guides you through exploring the Windows Registry, a critical component of the operating system. You'll delve into its structure, identifying key sections like HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

The primary goal is to locate the setting for the maximum password age, which controls how frequently machine account passwords must be changed. You'll use both manual methods, directly navigating through the registry, and a dedicated policy editor tool (secpol.msc).

While the manual approach can be informative, it's generally recommended to use the policy editor for accurate and secure configuration. The project concludes with an optional step to modify the password age and observe its impact on the registry.
